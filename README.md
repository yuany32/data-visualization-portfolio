### Data Analysis and Visualization with iPython
[_Examine the quality of the collected lab data_](https://github.com/yuany32/memory-research-analysis): Analysis of how well research participants performed in a designed "double-Y-maze" memory game, using correct number of trials and task durations as data quality indicators to explore what techniques human uses to learn and memorize tasks.  
- Some data visualization showcase:
  - Scatter plot with error bars of averaged trial accuracy for all participants
![average accuracy graphs for all participants](research_sample_graphs/group_accuracy_by_trial_criteria1.png)  

  - Scatter plot of one participant's trial accuracy with fit curve
![average accuracy graphs for participant 7](research_sample_graphs/subj7_criteria1_trial_rt.png)

  - Error bar plot of average reaction time for the first decision point and its consecutive images for all Participants

### Data Analysis and Visualization with R
[_Looking into immigration in the U.S._](https://info201a-wi20.github.io/project-report-yennhito/): Data analysis class group project at the information school, UW. The project focuses on various immigration indicators (admission rate, class of admission, apprehension rate, etc.) in the United States. The goal of the project is to advocate people and bring social awareness of the struggles that immigration population face with.
